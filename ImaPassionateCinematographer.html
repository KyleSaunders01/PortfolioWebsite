							<h1 class="major">I'm a passionate cinematographer</h1>
							<p>I started making videos of some gaming products when I was in high school and started to enjoy the filmmaking process a lot. I streamed some of my e-sport matches and did some more gaming videos and it really grew on me as hobby. When I got to University I took some pictures for friends and made some videos of cars and one day me and my girlfriend decided to start a little part time business making videos and taking photos. We learnt how to source clients, do marketing, hire other creatives to help us with work, work as a well functioning team and most importantly take amazing pictures and make brilliant videos.  </p>
							<p>Below you can see some of my work.</p>
