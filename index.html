							<h2>What I do</h2>
							<p>I'm a person with quite a few hobbies and interests, some of them include.</p>
							<div class="features">

									<h3>Programming</h3>
									<p>I've always had a knack for programming and started at the age of 14, doing everything from hello world to modding my favourite games. Programming has become a very big part of my life and I am very grateful to have discovered the world of programming and technology. It has had a very critical part in shaping me as a person and also leading me to the person I want to be one day. It has kept me very humble as just when you think you know something you learn something new and that is also true in life.</p>

									<span class="icon solid major fa-camera"></span>
									<h3>Photography/Videography</h3>
									<p>I have found that I can express myself in some interesting ways with the photos and videos that I produce. I also use these photos and videos to look back at some of the amazing things I have done throughout my life.</p>
								</section>
								<section>
									<span class="icon solid major fa-desktop"></span>
									<h3>Building Computers</h3>
									<p>I modified my first computer at a very young age, it being an old beige desktop with a CRT monitor I couldn't do much with it, but it did spark a big passion for everything tech. Since then I've been building and modifying computers left, right and center. It has evolved into me helping friends & family to build a functional gaming pc and even go to the extent of building full on Flight/Driving Simulators, and yes that includes the woodwork.</p>

									<h3>Flight/Driving Simulators</h3>
									<p>Simulators have always interested me. One of the first games I played as a little boy was Flight Simulator 2004 and rFactor. Since then I have chased down the most realistic Flight/Driving Sim experiences, that is within my budget of course, fast-forward to today I'm running a full flight/driving Simulator Rig that I'm very proud of. I hope to one day have the chance to become a Private Licensed Pilot and also enjoy some weekends at the track.</p>

									<h3>Kickboxing</h3>
									<p>Martial Arts is something I did for quite a while at young age but I only got back into in University, and boy does it teach you a lot of very valuable life lessons. It teaches us to be disciplined with our mind and body. Through this process you end up with a healthy and happy body.</p>

								<section>
									<span class="icon solid major fa-fish"></span>
									<h3>Hunting/Fishing</h3>
									<p>Hunting and Fishing was passed down to me by my Father like it is in most cases, to be honest this is my most fulfulling hobby. There is nothing better than being out in the bush or next to water, whether it be stalking an Impala with a bow or sitting calmly and waiting for the next fish to strike. It is definitely something that teaches you how to have patience in a stressful or even not so stressful environment, and to make the best of any situation. </p>
